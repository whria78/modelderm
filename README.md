The algorithm (Model Dermatology) could diagnose 184 skin conditions. The performance of standalone algorithm was comparable with that of dermatologists in experimental settings and comparable with that of general physicians in real world settings. Welcome to report any problems (whria78@gmail.com).

# Model Dermatology API Example

<pre><code>python3 modelderm.py
</code></pre>

Use a POST method to transfer up to 5 images and metadata. Please check the python example (python 2 or python 3). 

# Terms of Use
1) The algorithm is free. The API can be used for any purpose including commercial products.
2) Please do not submit images without permission of the original owner. 
3) All submitted images and metadata will be stored as a database. The images will be used solely for the training purpose of the algorithm. 
4) The algorithm has been verified in several retrospective and prospective studies, but please be sure that the algorithm is not certified by FDA or CE, yet.
5) We are not responsible for inaccurate diagnosis or technical problems (server down). Failover server will be available soon.

# Authorization (API Key)
At this moment, no authorization required. Please register at http://bbs.modelderm.com . We will notify the policy.

# Web-DEMO
The realtime DEMO is available at http://t.modelderm.com. 

# Algorithm
The algorithm has been developed and maintained by Han Seung Seog (I Dermatology).
