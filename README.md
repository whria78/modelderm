The algorithm (Model Dermatology) could diagnose 184 skin conditions. The performance of standalone algorithm was comparable with that of dermatologists in experimental settings and comparable with that of general physicians in real world settings. Welcome to report any problems (whria78@gmail.com).

# Model Dermatology API Example

<pre><code>python3 modelderm.py
</code></pre>

For the images without metadata, please edit the code as following, 
```
args2_='<id>image_id</id><race></race><birth></birth><sex></sex><location></location><pruritus></pruritus><pain></pain><onset></onset>'
```

Use a POST method to transfer up to 5 images and metadata. Please check the python example (python 2 or python 3). 

# Terms of Use
1) Free for non-commecial and research purpose. 
2) Please do not submit images without permission of the original owner. 
3) The algorithm has been verified in several retrospective and prospective studies, but please be sure that the algorithm is not certified by FDA, yet.
4) We are not responsible for inaccurate diagnosis or technical problems (server down). Failover server will be available soon.
